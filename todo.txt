add warnings for:
	-passing in a bin to a function with some of its members uninitialized,
	 and that function uses those members

refactoring:
	-potentially split ComputedExpr, TemplateReplacer, and ExprInterpreter, 
	 producing two functions: interpret, and instantiateType
	 (problem is they need the enviroment*, circular)
